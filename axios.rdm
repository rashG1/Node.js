### Axios Overview

Axios is a popular JavaScript library used to make HTTP requests. It simplifies the process of connecting with APIs and external services, whether you are working in a browser or Node.js environment.

#### Key Features:
- **Cross-platform**: Works seamlessly in both browser and Node.js environments.
- **Promise-based**: Axios returns Promises, making it easy to handle asynchronous operations.
- **Easy Configuration**: Provides a simple and intuitive way to configure HTTP requests.

#### How to Set Up Axios:

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

// Create an Axios instance with base configuration
const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'http://192.***.*.*:3000', // Replace with your backend's URL
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});

export default api;
```

##### Explanation:
- **`axios.create`**: Creates an Axios instance with default configuration.
- **`baseURL`**: The base URL of your API (replace `http://192.***.*.*:3000` with your backend's URL).
- **`headers`**: Default headers to send with each request, typically `Content-Type: application/json` for JSON requests.

### How to Use Axios in Your Application:
1. Import the `api` instance wherever you need to make API requests.
2. Use methods like `get`, `post`, `put`, or `delete` for different types of HTTP requests.
